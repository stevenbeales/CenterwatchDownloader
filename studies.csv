 The purpose of this study is to test the safety of DULERA. DULERA is a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (MDI) that contains two drugs combined, namely mometasone and formoterol in a single inhaler. Mometasone is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), which reduces the inflammation in the airways. Formoterol is a long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA), which helps to relax the muscles of the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. In combination, mometasone and formoterol are used for the treatment of asthma. This study will evaluate whether participants taking a LABA in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler have a different risk of having serious asthma events (hospitalization, intubation and death) compared to participants taking an ICS alone.

 The purpose of this study is to test the safety of DULERA. DULERA is a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (MDI) that contains two drugs combined, namely mometasone and formoterol in a single inhaler. Mometasone is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), which reduces the inflammation in the airways. Formoterol is a long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA), which helps to relax the muscles of the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. In combination, mometasone and formoterol are used for the treatment of asthma. This study will evaluate whether participants taking a LABA in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler have a different risk of having serious asthma events (hospitalization, intubation and death) compared to participants taking an ICS alone.

 The purpose of this study is to test the safety of DULERA. DULERA is a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (MDI) that contains two drugs combined, namely mometasone and formoterol in a single inhaler. Mometasone is an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), which reduces the inflammation in the airways. Formoterol is a long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA), which helps to relax the muscles of the airways in the lungs, making it easier to breathe. In combination, mometasone and formoterol are used for the treatment of asthma. This study will evaluate whether participants taking a LABA in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler have a different risk of having serious asthma events (hospitalization, intubation and death) compared to participants taking an ICS alone.

When the BMI reaches 40 or greater (morbid obesity), the NIH recognizes surgery as the only effective long-lasting treatment. Loss of 50% of excess weight is generally expected for greater than 5 years after surgery, as well as an improvement and/or resolution of co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea [2].

The rotator cuff muscles provide stability to the shoulder glenohumeral joint and can be torn by trauma or can tear through age related degeneration. Surgical repair is often used for these tears, but recent research has suggested less than complete efficacy, especially in larger tears. Despite historical wide spread use of surgery to repair partial thickness rotator cuff tears, the status of the evidence supporting this practice is poor and there is no widespread consensus on when surgical intervention is the best option. As a result, some practitioners have begun to wonder if injection therapy using biologics may be a robust non-surgical option to aid healing.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 65 Years,209193,"",Recruiting,
Cartilage Injuries,"Musculoskeletal Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery Trauma (Emergency, Injury, Surgery) Family Medicine","A Randomized Controlled Trial of Regenexx™ SD versus Exercise Therapy for Treatment of Partial and Complete, Non-retracted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears","There are an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repairs in the United States each year. Most ACL tears occur from noncontact injuries. The knee ACL provides stability to the knee joint and can be torn by trauma or can tear through age related degeneration. Surgical replacement with either an allograft (donor tissue) or autograft (your own tissue) is often used for these tears. However, recent research has suggested that no high level evidence exists that surgery is superior to conservative (non-surgical) care. The ACL contains fibrocytes (cells found in tissue such as tendons and ligaments) and adult stem cells (cells that can become different cell types to aid in healing). These cells have been characterized as similar to the mesenchymal stem cells found in bone marrow. However, the stem cells found in ACL ligaments aren’t as biologically robust as those found elsewhere in the knee, perhaps explaining why knee ACLs heal much more slowly. As a result, some doctors have begun to wonder if injecting the ACL with biologics may aid healing as an alternative to surgery. Regenexx™ SD for ACL repair is a procedure in which components of bone marrow from the back of your hip and blood drawn from your arm are concentrated and re-injected into the damaged ACL.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 65 Years,209187,"",Recruiting,

Colon Cancer,Oncology Gastroenterology Family Medicine,Identification of autoantibodies targeting genes implicated in metastatic cancer,"Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States today. The majority of cancer deaths can be attributed to the metastatic spread of solid tumors to distant organs. Medical progress in the last century has aided in the earlier identification of cancers limited to the primary organ and subsequent cure of these cancers with a combination of modalities – surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation. However, once cancer has invaded organs outside its primary site, the prognosis is grim; cure rates for metastatic cancer are even worse. The treatments of metastatic colorectal and breast cancer have made great improvements in the last 30 years compared to most other malignancies; a subset of patients with metastatic disease can expect to live 5 years after diagnosis with treatments with the latest chemotherapy regimens, but there remains a considerable need for more targeted combination therapies with fewer side effects. An emerging field in the last decade has been cancer immunology – the contribution of the immune system in controlling the oncologic process. Within cancer immunology, the role of autoantibodies – antibodies that target host factors rather than a foreign invader (typically viruses or bacteria) - is relatively unexplored. It is unclear at this time whether autoantibodies in the setting of cancer are a marker of disease progression, disease containment, or both. Antibody-based drugs have become increasingly common therapeutic options for all types of diseases including myocardial infarction, asthma, and cancer. Most of the antibody therapeutics were developed in the lab using the hybridoma technology – a process which involves using mice to develop antibodies against the protein of interest and fusing the antibody-producing cell with a human cancer cell. A selection process then ensues to find the cell that produces the antibody with the highest binding affinity to the protein of interest; this process can be tedious and painstaking. A method to screen for antibodies of interest in humans and subsequently isolate the cell that produces that antibody has been pioneered at the Rockefeller University; this method avoids some of the limitations of the hybridoma technology. In previous work, our lab has identified novel proteins implicated in colorectal and breast cancer metastasis. Some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – an autoimmune disease – produce autoantibodies to proteins implicated in colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver. Some patients with colorectal and breast cancer produce autoantibodies to a protein involved in breast cancer metastasis to the lung. In this project we seek to screen subjects with colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and SLE for autoantibodies toward our proteins of interests. The identification of autoantibodies that hinder metastatic growth has tremendous prognostic and therapeutic implications.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 100 Years,192610,"",,

It has a prevalence of up to 3-4% of adults and up to 25% among children. AD has a complex pathogenesis, characterized by: 1) immune activation with increased numbers of T-cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and increased expression of inflammatory molecules 2) marked epidermal hyperplasia in chronic diseased skin, and 3) defective barrier function with increased trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) and decreased lipids, reflecting underlying alterations in keratinocyte differentiation. AD is predominantly a Th2 (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31) disease, and recently was also found to be a “T22” (IL-22) polarized disease. An epidermal barrier defect in AD was lately strongly associated with a mutation in a major epidermal differientation protein filaggrin (in 1 q21 locus) although broad down regulation of multiple terminal differientation genes (such as loricrin and corneodesmosin) were recently found to potentially conribute to the barrier dysfunction.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 75 Years,192601,"",,

Hepatitis C; Chronic,"Immunology Gastroenterology Hepatology (Liver, Pancreatic, Gall Bladder) Infections and Infectious Diseases",Effects of Persistent Innate Immune Activation on Vaccine Efficacy,"Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver, caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment and transfusions. An estimated 150-200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can lead to scarring of the liver and ultimately to cirrhosis, which is generally apparent after many years. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will go on to develop liver failure, liver cancer or life-threatening esophageal and gastric varices (enlargement of veins that may rupture and cause serious blood loss). As people chronically infected with HCV are at increased risk of serious liver disease, it is recommended that they receive the hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine, which can protect them from infection by HBV, another virus that targets the liver.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 60 Years,205827,"",,

If an immune system is active for a long period of time, it may lead to problems such as heart, liver, and kidney disease. Many people who inject drugs are also infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). We have found that people who inject drugs have evidence of an activated immune system. We do not know whether the activated immune system we have measured is due to HCV infection or due to injection of drugs. In this study, we will compare the immune systems of people infected with HCV who are actively injecting drugs and those who are not injecting drugs before and after treating the HCV infection with a new oral medication, HARVONI. This is a combination of the medications Ledipasvir and Sofosbuvir. The reason for doing this research is to understand how HCV and injecting drugs contribute to the activation of the immune system and if treating HCV will decrease this activation.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 55 Years,205803,"",Recruiting,

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,Pulmonary/Respiratory Diseases,STX-100 in Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF),"PURPOSE
 Purpose:
 This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and impact on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood biomarkers of BG00011 (a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the v6 integrin, formerly known as STX-100) in patients with IPF. Approximately 40 patients will be enrolled into 5 sequential ascending dose cohorts. All cohorts will include 8 patients randomized to receive either BG00011 (6 patients) or placebo (2 patients). The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) may require that additional patients be included in a cohort if needed to better understand safety prior to dose escalation.

 Study Start Date: May 2012
 Estimated Primary Completion Date: October 2016 
 Phase: IIa

 Inclusion Criteria:
 * Consenting male or female patients, 45 to 84 years old, inclusive. Patients 18 to 44 years of age are eligible if they have a histopathologic diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) based upon a surgical lung biopsy in the appropriate clinical setting, and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria.
 * Clinical features consistent with IPF prior to screening (based on the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT consensus criteria for the diagnosis of IPF).
 * FVC greater than or equal to 50% of predicted value.
 * DLco (corrected for hemoglobin) greater than or equal to 30% predicted value.
 * Oxygen saturation > 90% at rest by pulse oximetry while breathing ambient air or receiving less than or equal to 2 L/minute of supplemental oxygen
 * Residual volume less than or equal to 120% predicted value.
 * Ratio of FEV1 to FVC greater than or equal to 0.65 after the use of a bronchodilator.
 * Other known causes of interstitial lung disease have been excluded (e.g., drug toxicities, environmental exposures, connective tissue diseases).
 * HRCT image fulfills the criteria for 'UIP pattern'. (surgical lung biopsy not required. The radiographic diagnosis of UIP must be confirmed on the screening HRCT by an independent central radiologist experienced in the evaluation of interstitial lung diseases). 
 * If the HRCT image does not fulfill the criteria for 'UIP pattern' a surgical lung biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis of IPF (lung biopsy performed prior to screening is acceptable). In this setting the HRCT image must meet the criteria for ?possible UIP pattern? and the lung biopsy must fulfill the histopathological criteria for either ?UIP pattern? or ?probable UIP pattern?. If the HRCT image fulfills the criteria for UIP pattern, results from a surgical lung biopsy are not necessary. If however, a lung biopsy has been performed, it must fulfill the histopathological criteria for either ?UIP pattern? or ?probable UIP pattern? with the appropriate HRCT correlate. * Adequate bone marrow and liver function.
 * Patient has a life expectancy of at least 12 months.
 * Subject must provide written informed consent. If required by local law, candidates must also authorize the release and use of protected health information (PHI). 
 * Female subjects must be surgically sterile, postmenopausal (minimum 1 year without menses), or agree to use 1 or more of the following forms of contraception from the time of signing the ICF through 12 weeks following the last injection of study medication: hormonal (i.e., oral, transdermal, implant, or injection); double barrier (i.e., condom, diaphragm with spermicide); intrauterine device; vasectomized partner (6 months minimum); or abstinence. Male subjects must also agree to use 1 or more of the above forms of birth control for either themselves or their partner(s), as appropriate, from the time of signing the ICF through 12 weeks following the last injection of study medication. 

 Exclusion Criteria:
 * Unable to perform PFTs
 * Findings that are diagnostic of a condition other than UIP on surgical lung biopsy, HRCT imaging, transbronchial lung biopsy, or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
 * Currently receiving high dose corticosteroid, cytotoxic (e.g., chlorambucil, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate), anti-fibrotic (e.g., pirfenidone or nintedanib), vasodilator therapy for pulmonary hypertension (e.g., bosentan), unapproved (e.g., INF-γ , penicillamine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, Nacetylcysteine), and/or investigational therapy for IPF or administration of such therapeutics within 5 half-lives of the agent prior to initial screening in this study. A current dose of less than or equal to 15 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent is acceptable if it is anticipated the dose will remain stable during the study.
 *Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) is permitted, provided that the subject has been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization and it is anticipated that the dose will remain stable during enrollment 
 * History of malignancy, including carcinoma during the preceding 5 years. However, subjects with a history of excised or treated basal cell, squamous cell, or cervical carcinomas are eligible to participate in this study.
 * Significant cardiac disease (e.g., New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class 3 or 4; myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; unstable angina; coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft [CABG] within the past 6 months; or uncontrolled atrial or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias).
 * Serious local infection or systemic infection within 3 months prior to screening.
 * Significant reaction to previous injection of a monoclonal antibody* Female who is pregnant or breastfeeding. 
 * Male or female planning a pregnancy during the duration of this study. A serum pregnancy test will be performed on all female subjects of childbearing potential. 
 * Fever (body temperature > 38°C) or symptomatic viral or bacterial infection within 1 week prior to screening. 
 * Positive test for HBsAg, HCV antibody (if confirmed by HCV RNA), or HIV antibody at screening.
 * Drug or alcohol abuse (as defined by the Investigator). 
 * Treatment with another investigational drug, investigational device, or approved therapy for investigational use within 5 half-lives of the agent prior to screening in this study.
 * End stage fibrotic disease requiring organ transplantation within 6 months.
 * Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator may compromise the safety or compliance of the subject or would preclude the subject from successful completion of the study","",Both Male and Female,N/A,179702,"",,

The rotator cuff muscles provide stability to the shoulder glenohumeral joint and can be torn by trauma or can tear through age related degeneration. Surgical repair is often used for these tears, but recent research has suggested less than complete efficacy, especially in larger tears. Despite historical wide spread use of surgery to repair partial thickness rotator cuff tears, the status of the evidence supporting this practice is poor and there is no widespread consensus on when surgical intervention is the best option. As a result, some practitioners have begun to wonder if injection therapy using biologics may be a robust non-surgical option to aid healing.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 65 Years,209194,"",Recruiting,
Joint Injuries,"Musculoskeletal Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery Trauma (Emergency, Injury, Surgery) Family Medicine","A Randomized Controlled Trial of Regenexx™ SD versus Exercise Therapy for Treatment of Partial and Complete, Non-retracted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears","There are an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repairs in the United States each year. Most ACL tears occur from noncontact injuries. The knee ACL provides stability to the knee joint and can be torn by trauma or can tear through age related degeneration. Surgical replacement with either an allograft (donor tissue) or autograft (your own tissue) is often used for these tears. However, recent research has suggested that no high level evidence exists that surgery is superior to conservative (non-surgical) care. The ACL contains fibrocytes (cells found in tissue such as tendons and ligaments) and adult stem cells (cells that can become different cell types to aid in healing). These cells have been characterized as similar to the mesenchymal stem cells found in bone marrow. However, the stem cells found in ACL ligaments aren’t as biologically robust as those found elsewhere in the knee, perhaps explaining why knee ACLs heal much more slowly. As a result, some doctors have begun to wonder if injecting the ACL with biologics may aid healing as an alternative to surgery. Regenexx™ SD for ACL repair is a procedure in which components of bone marrow from the back of your hip and blood drawn from your arm are concentrated and re-injected into the damaged ACL.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 65 Years,209188,"",Recruiting,

The rotator cuff muscles provide stability to the shoulder glenohumeral joint and can be torn by trauma or can tear through age related degeneration. Surgical repair is often used for these tears, but recent research has suggested less than complete efficacy, especially in larger tears. Despite historical wide spread use of surgery to repair partial thickness rotator cuff tears, the status of the evidence supporting this practice is poor and there is no widespread consensus on when surgical intervention is the best option. As a result, some practitioners have begun to wonder if injection therapy using biologics may be a robust non-surgical option to aid healing.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 65 Years,209195,"",Recruiting,
Lower Back Pain,Musculoskeletal Neurology Family Medicine Orthopedics/Orthopedic Surgery,"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Regenexx™ SD versus Exercise Therapy for Treatment of Partial and Complete, Non-retracted Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears","There are an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repairs in the United States each year. Most ACL tears occur from noncontact injuries. The knee ACL provides stability to the knee joint and can be torn by trauma or can tear through age related degeneration. Surgical replacement with either an allograft (donor tissue) or autograft (your own tissue) is often used for these tears. However, recent research has suggested that no high level evidence exists that surgery is superior to conservative (non-surgical) care. The ACL contains fibrocytes (cells found in tissue such as tendons and ligaments) and adult stem cells (cells that can become different cell types to aid in healing). These cells have been characterized as similar to the mesenchymal stem cells found in bone marrow. However, the stem cells found in ACL ligaments aren’t as biologically robust as those found elsewhere in the knee, perhaps explaining why knee ACLs heal much more slowly. As a result, some doctors have begun to wonder if injecting the ACL with biologics may aid healing as an alternative to surgery. Regenexx™ SD for ACL repair is a procedure in which components of bone marrow from the back of your hip and blood drawn from your arm are concentrated and re-injected into the damaged ACL.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 65 Years,209189,"",Recruiting,

Rectal Cancer,Oncology Gastroenterology Family Medicine,Identification of autoantibodies targeting genes implicated in metastatic cancer,"Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States today. The majority of cancer deaths can be attributed to the metastatic spread of solid tumors to distant organs. Medical progress in the last century has aided in the earlier identification of cancers limited to the primary organ and subsequent cure of these cancers with a combination of modalities – surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation. However, once cancer has invaded organs outside its primary site, the prognosis is grim; cure rates for metastatic cancer are even worse. The treatments of metastatic colorectal and breast cancer have made great improvements in the last 30 years compared to most other malignancies; a subset of patients with metastatic disease can expect to live 5 years after diagnosis with treatments with the latest chemotherapy regimens, but there remains a considerable need for more targeted combination therapies with fewer side effects. An emerging field in the last decade has been cancer immunology – the contribution of the immune system in controlling the oncologic process. Within cancer immunology, the role of autoantibodies – antibodies that target host factors rather than a foreign invader (typically viruses or bacteria) - is relatively unexplored. It is unclear at this time whether autoantibodies in the setting of cancer are a marker of disease progression, disease containment, or both. Antibody-based drugs have become increasingly common therapeutic options for all types of diseases including myocardial infarction, asthma, and cancer. Most of the antibody therapeutics were developed in the lab using the hybridoma technology – a process which involves using mice to develop antibodies against the protein of interest and fusing the antibody-producing cell with a human cancer cell. A selection process then ensues to find the cell that produces the antibody with the highest binding affinity to the protein of interest; this process can be tedious and painstaking. A method to screen for antibodies of interest in humans and subsequently isolate the cell that produces that antibody has been pioneered at the Rockefeller University; this method avoids some of the limitations of the hybridoma technology. In previous work, our lab has identified novel proteins implicated in colorectal and breast cancer metastasis. Some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – an autoimmune disease – produce autoantibodies to proteins implicated in colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver. Some patients with colorectal and breast cancer produce autoantibodies to a protein involved in breast cancer metastasis to the lung. In this project we seek to screen subjects with colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and SLE for autoantibodies toward our proteins of interests. The identification of autoantibodies that hinder metastatic growth has tremendous prognostic and therapeutic implications.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 100 Years,192611,"",,

Scleroderma,Dermatology Rheumatology Neurology Family Medicine,A proposal to search for evidence of active platelet-derived TGF-ß1 and its impact on leukocytes in Systemic Sclerosis,"Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a devastating and often life threatening illness predominantly affecting women characterized by autoimmunity, widespread microvascular disease, and fibrosis, especially of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and lung. Multiple studies have shown evidence of platelet activation in SSc. Chronic intermittent vasospasm in the microvasculature combined with platelet aggregation and activation may foster an environment in which TGF-ß1 is released and activated. Our laboratory has shown that latent TGF-ß1, a complex composed of mature TGF- ß1 dimer noncovalently attached to latency associated peptide (LAP) dimer, which in turn is disulfide-bonded to latent TGF-ß1 binding protein-1 (LTBP-1), is activated in vitro by shear by a mechanism that includes thiol-disulfide exchange. Latent TGF-ß1 is released from most cells and tissues as large latent complexes (LLCs) comprised of LTBP-1, LAP, and TGF-ß1. Platelets are the largest source of TGF-ß1 in normal blood. Since high shear can both induce platelet activation, with release of granule contents, and activate TGF-ß1 in vitro, we hypothesize that high shear in the stenotic and compromised microvasculature of SSc patients results in platelet release of latent TGF-ß1 as well as other profibrotic, vasoconstrictive, and proinflammatory mediators. The released latent TGF-ß1 may then undergo activation, at least in part, by intravascular shear force. In addition, the other released platelet mediators may abet the vascular leak seen in SSc and allow extravasation of leukocytes and egress of both active and latent TGF-ß1 into the skin and other affected tissues, where the latter can be stored and/or activated in the extracellular matrix. TGF-ß1 signaling is known to induce other cells to produce TGF-ß1 in a feed-forward manner.","",Both Male and Female,18 to 75 Years,192603,"",,
